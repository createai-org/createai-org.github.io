<h3  id="section5.1">5.1. Neural connections</h3>
 
<dd> 
	A <i><b>Connectome</b></i> is the map of the connections between neurons in the brain.
<p></p>
	These inter-neuronal connections facilitate in encoding stimuli, deciphering stimuli and shaping the lifeform's overall behaviour.
	All incoming stimuli is encoded in the brain in the form of connections between neurons. 
<p></p>
	When a new memory is formed, it is done so through modification of the weights of the inter-neuronal connections.
	Impluses to initiate and implement specific actions are encoded by these connections.
<br><br><br>
<h3 id="section5.2">5.2. Two Types of Connections</h3>
	<dd><p>
	<p></p>
	  In this model, Connections are differentiated into two categories :
	  <p/>
		<p/>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;   <b>hardwired connections</b> , which are stable and don't strengthen/weaken 
		<p/>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;   <b>dynamic connections</b> ,  which are created based on neural activity and allowed to strenghten &amp; weaken. 
	 
	<p></p> 

	</p>
	</dd>
<br>
	<h3  id="section5.3">5.3. Innate (hardwired) connections for survival</h3>
	<dd><p>
		Neuronal connections which enable <i>food-seeking</i> and <i>danger avoidance</i> aid the survival of the lifeform. 
		When a biological organism has just been born, it has to survive in a specific environment, and innate connections related to food-seeking/danger-avoidance behaviour aid in its survival.
		
<p></p>
		Such innate connections enable <i>"Primitive reflexes"</i> <sup><a href='part8.html#r2'>[2]</a></sup> , which is the execution of certain motor action sequences on encountering a particular stimuli.
		For example, in human infants,  <i>rooting reflex</i>,  <i>stepping reflex</i>,  <i>palmar grasp reflex</i>,etc. are observed.
		After sometime after birth, such reflexes either come under voluntary control, or fade away.
<p></p>
		Therefore any Artificial Lifeform should be preloaded with some innate connections to enable survival in the specific environment it is supposed to be 'placed'.
</dd></p>	

<br><br>	 
		<h3  id="section5.4">5.4. Creation of new dynamic connections	</h3>

		 
	<dd><p>
		
		Sensory organs receive the stimuli many times per second and transmit the signals to the brain simultaneously as a continuous datastream.
		The brain receives sensory datastreams of various types (vision,sound,etc.) simultaneously.
		Regions of the brain are specifically mapped to sensory type (eg: visual stimuli mapped to  occipital lobe).
		To form an association between stimuli, connections need to be formed between the corresponding neurons that encode the different stimuli.
<p></p>

	Let <b>H </b>be the maximum delay allowed in forming connections  ie., connections with a delay of upto <b>t+H </b>synaptic timesteps are allowed in the brain.
	<br><br>
		<span style='font-weight:bold;font-size:0.9em;color:#555'>Criteria for new connection formation :	</span> 
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>In this model,criteria for forming  new connections will be based on Hebbian learning, which can be loosely stated as <i>"Neurons that fire (almost) together, wire together"</i>. 
</li>
		<li>If neuron A and neuron B are activated within a short time (within  <b>H</b>  synaptic timesteps of each other), then a dynamic connection is created between neuron A and neuron B. (provided that neural pathway is permitted)</li>
		<li>For example, if <span style='color:darkred;font-weight:bold;'>neuron A </span> fires at time <b>t</b> and <span style='color:darkred;font-weight:bold;'>neuron B </span> fires at <b>t+X</b> synaptic timestep,  a <b>(t+X)</b> dynamic connection is created from neuron A to neuron B. <i> (where 1&lt;=X&lt;=H )</i> </li>

	<ol type='A'  >
	 	
	<li >
		<i>Hardwired connections</i> are deemed stable and not strengthened or weakened.

	<li>Whenever a neuron fires, all its incoming <i>dynamic connections</i> are weakened except those dynamic connections which caused it to fire.

	<h3  id="section5.7">5.7. Explaining Classical conditioning using this model	</h3>
	<dd><p>
	
	Using the above criteria for dynamic connection creation/strenghtening/weakening, it is possible to explain how (Pavolovian) classical conditioning can occur.
	<br> <br> 
	In the following two examples,
	<br> &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let  neuron "A" be the "Unconditioned Stimulus"  and "neuron C" firing be the "Unconditioned Response".
	<br> &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let neuron B be the "neutral stimulus"
	<br> &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the Unconditioned stimulus A and neutral stimulus B are fired simultaneously, a (t+X) connection forms between the neutral stimulus B and the unconditioned response C.

		<div style='padding:9px;font-size:0.8em;text-align:left;'>	  <br> In this example, H=1, so upto (t+1) connections are allowed to form.

			  <br><br> <b>Step 2:</b>  &nbsp;  Click "Activate only B"  : Using the newly formed connection, triggering B alone will cause C to fire.
			  <br><br> <b>Step 3:</b>  &nbsp;  Click "Activate only A"  : Since A causes C to fire at time t without B being active at (t-1), the criteria for weakening is satisfied, and therefore the strength of the <b>t+1</b> dynamic connection from <b>B</b>  to <b>C</b>  is weakened repeatedly, until it is removed.
